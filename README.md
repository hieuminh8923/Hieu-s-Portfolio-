## About
Hi, I'm Hieu! I'm a soon-to-graduate from Foreign Trade University in Hanoi with an excellent Bachelor's degree in International Business Administration. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in business and economics, which I have leveraged to gain proficiency in data analysis and data visualization. I am particularly interested in using data to solve business problems and tell compelling stories that drive informed decision-making.

I am a highly self-motivated learner with a proven ability to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios. I am also a confident and articulate communicator, with a proven ability to work effectively in both individual and team settings. In my university years, I actively participated in extracurricular activities and leadership roles, which further honed my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills.

I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a challenging data analyst role where I can make a real impact on a business. I am confident that my ability to learn quickly, think critically, and communicate effectively will make me a valuable asset to any team.
