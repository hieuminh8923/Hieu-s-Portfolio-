# Duong Minh Hieu - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Hieu! I'm a soon-to-graduate from Foreign Trade University in Hanoi with an excellent Bachelor's degree in International Business Administration. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in business and economics, which I have leveraged to gain proficiency in data analysis and data visualization. I am particularly interested in using data to solve business problems and tell compelling stories that drive informed decision-making.

I am a highly self-motivated learner with a proven ability to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios. I am also a confident and articulate communicator, with a proven ability to work effectively in both individual and team settings. In my university years, I actively participated in extracurricular activities and leadership roles, which further honed my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills.

I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a challenging data analyst role where I can make a real impact on a business. I am confident that my ability to learn quickly, think critically, and communicate effectively will make me a valuable asset to any team.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Accessibility to Credit of Residents in Vinh Phuc Province, Vietnam
**Code:** [Analyzing the Accessibility to Credit of Residents in Vinh Phuc Province, Vietnam]([url](https://github.com/hieuminh8923/Hieu-s-Portfolio-/blob/main/Excel_Vinh_Phuc_Province_Credit_Accessibility_Analysis))

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the accessibility of credit of residents in Vinh Phuc Province, Vietnam

**Description:** This project focused on analyzing survey data regarding credit accessibility for residents in Vinh Phuc Province, Vietnam. The dataset included responses from a [survey](https://github.com/hieuminh8923/Hieu-s-Portfolio-/blob/main/Word_Credit_Accessibility_Survey) covering aspects such as credit availability, application processes, and demographic information. The project involved loading the survey data into Excel, cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing correlations between various data points to understand credit accessibility trends and visualize to gain actionable insights.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data comprehension, excel functions , data visualization.

**Results:** 
From the database, identify customers who need to use financial services, the influence of demographic factors, the satisfaction status of customers using the service as well as the purpose of service use

**Technology:** Excel 

### Covid 19 Exploratory Analysis
**Code:** [ Covid 19 Exploratory Analysis]([url](https://github.com/hieuminh8923/Hieu-s-Portfolio-/blob/main/SQL_Covid19_EDA))

**Visualisation :**[Covid 19 Exploratory Data Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hieu.duong5905/viz/Project1-Tableau_17167468973560/Dashboard1)

**Goal:** From this data, consider the current situation and severity of the covid 19 epidemic in the period from 2022 to 2024. At the same time, consider the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing deaths caused by Covid 19.

**Description:**  The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in the period 1/1/2022 - 4/4/2024. The data management process includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis). The infomation drawn from the analysis then visualized into insightful visualisation

**Results** The analysis identified a clear link between vaccination and reduced COVID-19 severity. Death rates dropped significantly as vaccination rates rose. It also provided a geographical perspective, comparing how different regions fared based on vaccination coverage. The analysis further emphasized the effectiveness of vaccination by demonstrating a correlation between higher vaccination rates and lower death tolls, as well as less severe outbreaks. To illustrate these trends and connections, data visualizations like line graphs, bar charts, and heat maps were created.

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server, Tableau
